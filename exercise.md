## Pygame snake and apple tutorial exercise

1. Add a logic to end the game if snake hits any of the wall boundaries of main screen. 
Here you need to check the position of your head and see if it goes beyond window boundaries (1000,800). 
If it does, game should end in same way as we end it when snake collides with itself.

2. Try increasing speed of snake to make game little more challenging.  Reduce the sleep time to may be 0.1 sec to achieve this.
